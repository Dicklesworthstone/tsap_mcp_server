# Technical Specification: Data Processing System

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the technical specifications for the Data Processing System, a scalable platform designed to ingest, process, and analyze large volumes of structured and unstructured data.

### 1.1 Purpose

The Data Processing System aims to provide a unified platform for data scientists and analysts to process data efficiently, apply transformations, and generate meaningful insights.

### 1.2 Scope

This specification covers the system architecture, components, interfaces, and performance requirements. It does not include operational procedures or user training documentation.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Overview

The system follows a modular microservices architecture with the following main components:

- Data Ingestion Service
- Storage Service
- Processing Engine
- Analysis Framework
- Visualization Interface
- API Gateway

| Visualization   |<-----|  Analysis      |<-----|  API Gateway   |
+----------------+      +----------------+      +----------------+
```

## 3. Technical Requirements

### 3.1 Performance Requirements

| Metric | Requirement |
|--------|-------------|
| Data ingestion rate | Min 10,000 records/second |
| Query response time | < 500ms for 95th percentile |
| Processing latency | < 2 seconds for standard transformations |
| Availability | 99.9% uptime |
| Scalability | Support for horizontal scaling |

### 3.2 Data Requirements

The system shall support the following data formats:
- JSON
- CSV
- Parquet
- XML
- Unstructured text

### 3.3 Interface Requirements

All services shall expose RESTful APIs with the following characteristics:
- OpenAPI 3.0 specification compliant
- JSON response format
- OAuth 2.0 authentication
- Rate limiting
- Versioning through URL path
